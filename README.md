# triginometry

This simple calculator uses the pygame library to add a visual display to the triginomety calculator.
I have plans to change this to add numbers to the display and to allow the user to change the values through the window.
The values for lenght will have to be quite large as the window is 1000 by 1000 in this calculator but
there is nothing stopping the user from making a tringle to big or too small other than the obvious limitations of triangles 
(eg. no angle can be over 90 degrees)
